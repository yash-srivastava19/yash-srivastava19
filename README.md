* Hi, I'm @yash-srivastava19. I'm a machine learning and computer vision enthusiast, with a particular interest in deep reinforcement learning, neuroimaging, quantum machine learning.

* Currently, I'm learning about quantum machine learning with Qiskit and TensorFlow Quantum, as well as furthering my knowledge in deep reinforcement learning with ChainerRL and Dopamine. I'm also exploring the fields of reinforcement learning, MLOps with TFX and recommender systems.

* I'm passionate about researching and learning about technologies that have the potential to make a big impact in our lives. As an advocate for responsible, trustworthy, and secure AI, I believe in the importance of ethical considerations in the development and deployment of artificial intelligence.
