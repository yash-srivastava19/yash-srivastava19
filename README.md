* Hi, I'm @yash-srivastava19. I'm a machine learning research enthusiast, with a particular interest in deep reinforcement learning, neuroimaging, quantum machine learning and Artificial Intelligence in general.

* Currently, I'm learning about quantum machine learning with Qiskit and TensorFlow Quantum, as well as furthering my knowledge in deep reinforcement learning with ChainerRL. I'm also exploring the fields of reinforcement learning, natural language processing, MLOps with TFX and recommender systems.

* I'm passionate about researching and learning about technologies that have the potential to make a big impact in our lives. As an advocate for responsible, trustworthy, and secure AI, I believe in the importance of ethical considerations in the development and deployment of artificial intelligence.

* I strongly belive in learning with collaboration, so if you want to improve upon some of my project, we can discuss in length about it. You just have to ping me. I think I am friendly and approachable ðŸ™‚.
